# TODO:

- Write algorithm that covers all combinations of characters of serial length
- Find upper limit of serial length number before overflow, then use an
if-statement to report an error to user.
- Update README.md with all rules and pitfalls to be aware of when using this
software
- After software works, work on removing all warnings thrown by Rust compiler
- Refactor larger functions
- Optimizations (reducing bit size of integers to lowest they can go, larger
optimizations)
- Clean up function order
- Make all static sized vectors arrays (main vector and index vector)
- Go over all code to make sure we are hitting all combinations
- Update README.md to say "probably unique", since a random shuffle could be the
same as a previous, but it highly unlikely
- Add checks to make sure we aren't exceeding the length of 20
- Using a 4 length and numbers only, we can see that there are many duplicates,
big bug
- Refactor
