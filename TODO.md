# TODO:

- Optimizations (reducing bit size of integers to lowest they can go, larger
  optimizations)
- Remove warnings
- See if any typecasts are inefficient or affect the evenness of the probability
- Double check that index increase is correct, run tests (clean up this code as
  well)
- Make sure all variable state types
- Double check all of README.md and fix discrepancies.
- Can math notation be used in README.md?
- Should numbers in README.md us `` code symbols?
- In the main, set up some sort of input section and then compile the app for
  GitHub releases (pick an appropriate version number v(1.0.0?))
- Fix interface, not clean code, no error checking, should probably be using
  stdin
