# TODO:

- Optimizations (reducing bit size of integers to lowest they can go, larger
  optimizations)
- Update README.md to say "probably unique", since a random shuffle could be the
  same as a previous, but it highly unlikely
- Add checks to make sure we aren't exceeding the length of 20
- Remove warnings
- See if any typecasts are inefficient or affect the evenness of the probability
- Double check that index increase is correct, run tests (clean up this code as
  well)
- See where I can pass in and return references to make app faster and more
  efficient
- Break all long parameter lists in the same way
- Update README.md with all rules and pitfalls to be aware of when using this
  software.  Include a sample of the licenses using ... notation.  Include
  example output of the app and use the index output to show how small numbers
  of licenses don't pull drastically different numbers.  Explain how it works.
  Document extremely well!
