# TODO:

- Optimizations (reducing bit size of integers to lowest they can go, larger
  optimizations)
- Remove warnings
- See if any typecasts are inefficient or affect the evenness of the probability
- Double check that index increase is correct, run tests (clean up this code as
  well)
- See where I can pass in and return references to make app faster and more
  efficient
- Break all long parameter lists in the same way
- Make sure all variable state types
- Double check all of README.md and fix discrepancies.
- Can math notation be used in README.md?
- Should numbers in README.md us `` code symbols?
