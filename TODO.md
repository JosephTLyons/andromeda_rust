# TODO:

## Must Do:

- Optimizations (reducing bit size of integers to lowest they can go, larger
  optimizations)
- Remove warnings
- See if any typecasts are inefficient or affect the evenness of the probability
- Double check all of README.md and fix discrepancies.
- Can math notation be used in README.md?
- Fix interface, not clean code, no error checking, should probably be using
  stdin over the crate
- Clean up how file path is printed, refactor code for it as well

## New Features:

- Print statistics to terminal (currently broken - may not be possible)
